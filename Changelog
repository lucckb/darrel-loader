  * Added intprint function.
	* Added memory size detection (Thanks to Andrés for his ideas)
  * Added a simple memory test feature, similar to the one that it already
	  had. But this time, we check all the detected memory.
	* Now we make scans = 0 after a "Dataflash not found" message.
	  It helps debug the loader. Before the menu would repeat itself too fast.
	* Added a coment to the 'leds' function in board.c, that is not being used.
